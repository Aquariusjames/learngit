# Testing network bandwidth using iperf3

## Background
Sometimes you want to test the network connection between two computers. Which tool will you use? Using web server and wget is an option, but itâ€™s not very direct.

Using iperf3, you can easily measure the bandwidth from the client to the server as well as the bandwidth from the server to the client easily.

## How to install iperf3
Installing iperf3 on Debian/Ubuntu only needs one simple command.

`apt install iperf3`

On macOS, using homebrew is also very easy.

`brew install iperf3`

## How to use iperf3
On one of the computer (regarding as server), run iperf3 -s.

On the other computer (regarding as client), a common test is iperf3 -i 1 -t 30 -c SERVER_IP, which shows the result per second and lasts 30 seconds.
Note: This command shows the transfer speed from the client to the server. If you want the reverse, just add -R to the command.
